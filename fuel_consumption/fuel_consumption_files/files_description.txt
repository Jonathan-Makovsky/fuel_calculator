Files description:
All the files were taken from https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64 (Government of Canada).
Datasets provide model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.

* Model	
	4WD/4X4 = Four-wheel drive
	AWD = All-wheel drive
	CNG = Compressed natural gas
	FFV = Flexible-fuel vehicle
	NGV = Natural gas vehicle
	SWB = Short wheelbase
	LWB = Long wheelbase
	EWB = Extended wheelbase
	# = High output engine that provides more power than the standard engine of the same size
* Transmission	
	A = Automatic
	AM = Automated manual
	AS = Automatic with select shift
	AV = Continuously variable
	M = Manual
	3 â€“ 10 = Number of gears
* Fuel Type	
	X = Regular gasoline

	D = Diesel
	E = Ethanol (E85)
	N = Natural Gas
* Fuel Consumption
	City and highway fuel consumption ratings are shown in litres per 100 kilometres (L/100 km) - combined rating (55% city, 45% hwy) is shown in L/100 km and in miles per imperial gallon (mpg)
* CO2 Emissions 
	(g/km)	Estimated tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions (in grams per kilometre) are based on fuel type and the combined fuel consumption rating.
* CO2 rating	
	the tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide rated on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best)
* Smog rating	
	the tailpipe emissions of smog-forming pollutants rated on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best)
